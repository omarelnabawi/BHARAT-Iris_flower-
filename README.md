# BHARAT-Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview

This project, completed during my internship at Beharat, involves classifying Iris flowers into different species using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The project leverages the classic Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning.

## Project Structure

- **`Iris.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`svc_model.pkl`**: The trained SVC model saved for future use.
- **`label_encoder.pkl`**: The Label Encoder used to transform categorical labels into numerical form.
- **`app.py`**: The Streamlit app for user interaction, allowing users to input flower measurements and receive predictions.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
   cd iris-classification
